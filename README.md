# Deep Learning 2019 Project

This is the repo for my Deep Learning term project. This project consists of a recreation of the paper [Net2Net: Accelerating Learning via Knowledge Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05641) using [Julia](https://julialang.org/) and [Knet](https://github.com/denizyuret/Knet.jl)
